Standard configuration files for test setups.

Test configurations expect a number of environment variables to be set up.
Within the test framework this is done by the test execution script,
which creates a second lua config with the variables.

The following variables are defined:

TEST_PROG     - name of executable containing test
REQUIRED_MODULES - list of additional modules loaded (filename only)
