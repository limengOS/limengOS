# L4virtio

This package provides an implementation of the
[Virtio protocol](https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/virtio-v1.0.html)
for the L4Re operating system. It defines a custom transport protocol
that is largely compatible with the virtio mmio transport but in addition
relies on L4 mechanisms for synchronisation.

# Documentation

This package is part of the L4Re operating system. For documentation and
build instructions see the
[L4Re wiki](https://kernkonzept.com/L4Re/guides/l4re).
