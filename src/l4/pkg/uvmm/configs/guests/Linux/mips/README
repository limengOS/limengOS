How to build a Linux kernel to be used as a guest kernel in uvmm?

The following brief instructions assume that the reader has
a basic knowledge how to build Linux and has the necessary
environment and tools installed.

This directory contains patches against various versions
of the Linux kernel. Choose the appropriate patch and apply with

/tmp $ cd linux-4.4
/tmp/linux-4.4 $ patch -p1 -i /path/to/pkg/uvmm/configs/guests/Linux/mips/0001-MIPS-Add-virtual-platform-linux-4.4.patch

Configure the kernel:

/tmp/linux-4.4 $ make ARCH=mips mach_virt_defconfig

Further configure the kernel to your needs.

Build:

/tmp/linux-4.4 $ make ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-linux-

The resulting file /tmp/linux-4.4/vmlinux is used as a kernel
for uvmm.
