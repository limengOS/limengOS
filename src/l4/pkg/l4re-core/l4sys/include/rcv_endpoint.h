/**
 * Bind the IPC receive endpoint to a thread.
 * \ingroup l4_kernel_object_gate_api
 *
 * \param ep      The IPC receive endpoint object.
 * \param thread  The thread object that shall be bound to `ep`.
 * \param label   Label to assign to `ep`. The two least significant bits
 *                should usually be set to zero.
 *
 * \return Syscall return tag containing one of the following return codes.
 *
 * \retval L4_EOK      Operation successful.
 * \retval -L4_EINVAL  `thread` is not a thread object or other arguments were
 *                     malformed.
 * \retval -L4_EPERM   No #L4_CAP_FPAGE_S rights on `ep` or `thread`.
 *
 *  The specified `label` is passed to the receiver of the incoming IPC. It is
 *  possible to re-bind a receive endpoint to the same or a different thread.
 *  In this case, IPC already in flight will be delivered with the old label to
 *  the previously bound thread unless l4_thread_modify_sender_start() is used
 *  to change these labels.
