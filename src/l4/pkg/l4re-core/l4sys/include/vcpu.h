/**
 * \defgroup l4_vcpu_api vCPU API
 * \ingroup  l4_thread_api
 * vCPU API.
 *
 * The vCPU API in L4Re implements virtual processors (vCPUs) on top of
 * L4::Thread. This API can be used for user level threading, operating system
 * rehosting (see L4Linux) and virtualization.
 *
 * You switch a thread into `vCPU` operation with L4::Thread::vcpu_control.
 *
 * In vCPU mode, incoming IPC can be redirected to a handler function. If an
 * IPC is sent to the vCPU, the thread's normal execution is interrupted and the
 * handler called. Which kind of IPC is redirected is specified by the
 * #L4_vcpu_state_flags set in the l4_vcpu_state_t::state field of `vcpu_state`.
 * All events enabled in the `vcpu_state` field are redirected to the handler.
 * The handler is set via l4_vcpu_state_t::entry_ip and
 * l4_vcpu_state_t::entry_sp. IPC redirection works independent of "kernel"
 * and "user" mode, but see l4_vcpu_state::entry_sp. When the entry handler is
 * called, the UTCB contains the result of the IPC and content normally found
 * in CPU register is in l4_vcpu_state_t::i.
 *
 * Furthermore, the thread can execute in the context of different tasks,
 * called the "kernel" and the "user" mode. The kernel task is the one to which
 * the thread was originally bound via L4::Thread::control(). Execution starts
 * in the kernel task and it is always switched to when the asynchronous IPC
 * handler is invoked. When returning from the handler via
 * L4::Thread::vcpu_resume_start() and L4::Thread::vcpu_resume_commit(), a
 * different user task can be specified by setting l4_vcpu_state_t::user_task
 * and enabling the #L4_VCPU_F_USER_MODE flag in l4_vcpu_state_t::state.
 *
 * If the #L4_VCPU_F_USER_MODE flag is enabled, the following flags will be
 * automatically enabled in l4_vcpu_state_t::state on
 * L4::Thread::vcpu_resume_commit():
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_IRQ
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_PAGE_FAULTS
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_EXCEPTIONS
 *
 * When the kernel mode is entered, the following flags will be automatically
 * disabled in l4_vcpu_state_t::state:
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_IRQ
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_PAGE_FAULTS
 * - #L4_VCPU_F_USER_MODE
 *
 * Extended vCPU operation is used for hardware CPU virtualization. It can
 * be enabled with L4::Thread::vcpu_control_ext().
 *
 * \ref api_libvcpu defines a convenience API for working with vCPUs.
 *
 * \see api_libvcpu
