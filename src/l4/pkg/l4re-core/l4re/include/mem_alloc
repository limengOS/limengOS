/**
 * Memory allocation interface.
 *
 * The memory-allocator API is the basic API to allocate memory from the
 * L4Re subsystem. The memory is allocated in terms of dataspaces (see
 * L4Re::Dataspace). The provided dataspaces have at least the
 * property that data written to such a dataspace is available as long
 * as the dataspace is not freed or the data is not overwritten. In particular,
 * the memory backing a dataspace from an allocator need not be allocated
 * instantly, but may be allocated lazily on demand.
 *
 * A memory allocator can provide dataspaces with additional properties,
 * such as physically contiguous memory, pre-allocated memory, or pinned
 * memory. To request memory with an additional property the
 * L4Re::Mem_alloc::alloc() method provides a flags parameter. If the
 * concrete implementation of a memory allocator does not support or allow
 * allocation of memory with a certain property, the allocation may be
 * refused.
